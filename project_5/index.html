                                    “Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.”

                                    If your goal is to please everyone, you will always fall short; you will never make everyone happy. Listening to everyone’s opinions about your life can be very discouraging and it’s important to not let others’ judgments of your dreams and goals drown out your hope. Don’t let your innermost spark, the passion that ignites you, die.

                                    How many of us have jobs we hate? How many of us live our lives in misery because we’re too scared to take risks? The greatest joy comes from living a life outside of our comfort zones, where we live vulnerably and authentically. We are called not to live sheltered lives but to boldly live our purpose.

And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.”

If you feel unfulfilled in your career, keep looking until you find what you love to do.

You only live once. Make it count.
